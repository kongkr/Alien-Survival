# Alien-Survival
Can you survive?!


'You’re an Alien, send on a mission to explore the new planet called "Earth".

Your masters have send you on this mission to gain information about the culture & technology on “Earth”.
They’ve warned you that the atmosphere is deadly and you’ll need to get back to your ship alive and well. 

Thankfully, the scientists of our home planet found a way to survive in this harsh atmosphere. WE CAN SURVIVE ON BRAINS!

And how convenient...
When we eat a human’s brain we also collect all the intel that this person collected during his life. 
But be careful, not all brains are as healthy as they seem!

Their might also be other ways to survive, but brains are your best shot at survival.
Be careful & try to collect as many intel as you can. 

Good luck.'

You have some settings in game like boundaries, motion & select an alien.
The boundaries & motion sensor switches enables you to play the game with or without boundaries/motion sensor.
You can select out of 3 aliens to play with, try them all!

You can challenge your friends to get the best score, the most brains or fishes! 
If you want you can check your stats in the "Stats" menu, 
this way you can compair your scores with your friends to find out who's the true survivor!
(You can also reset your stats, if you want to start over on a clean slate)

Enjoy & try to survive!
